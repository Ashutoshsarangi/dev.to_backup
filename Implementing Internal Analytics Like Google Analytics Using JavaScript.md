## Introduction

- In today's data-driven world, understanding user behavior is crucial for making informed decisions that enhance user experience and drive business success.
- Google Analytics is a popular tool for tracking website interactions, but sometimes companies require an internal analytics solution tailored to their specific needs.
- One efficient way to achieve this is by leveraging JavaScript and the **Navigator.sendBeacon** API to build a custom internal analytics system.

**What is Navigator.sendBeacon?**

- The Navigator.sendBeacon API is a modern web technology that allows you to send small amounts of data to a server without affecting the performance of your web application.
- It is particularly well-suited for sending analytics data because it operates asynchronously, meaning it doesn't block the main thread or interfere with the user experience.
- This method is used to send small amounts of data to a server without waiting for a response, which is perfect for analytics data. 

**Why Use Internal Analytics?**

- While Google Analytics offers a comprehensive set of features, there are several reasons why a company might prefer an internal analytics solution:

**Data Privacy and Security:** 

- With an internal solution, you maintain full control over your data, which is crucial for companies dealing with sensitive information.

**Customization:**

- Internal analytics can be tailored to meet the specific needs of your business, tracking custom events, and metrics that may not be available in off-the-shelf solutions.

**Cost Efficiency:**

- For companies with high traffic volumes, the cost of third-party analytics services can add up. An internal solution can be more cost-effective in the long run.

**Implementing Internal Analytics with sendBeacon**

```javascript
document.addEventListener("visibilitychange", function logData() {
  if (document.visibilityState === "hidden") {
    navigator.sendBeacon("/log", analyticsData);
  }
});
```
**Advantages of Using sendBeacon for Analytics**

**Reliable Data Transmission:**

- sendBeacon is specifically designed to send data during page unloads, reducing the risk of data loss.

**Minimal Impact on Performance:**

- Since sendBeacon operates asynchronously, it doesn't block the main thread, ensuring a smooth user experience.

**Browser Support:**

- The sendBeacon API is widely supported by modern browsers, making it a reliable choice for most web applications.

``` Javascript
const success = navigator.sendBeacon("https://httpbin.org/post", JSON.stringify({ test: "data" }));
console.log("Beacon sent:", success);
```
